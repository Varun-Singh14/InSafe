# Campus Safety App [INSAFE]

The Campus Safety App is a ReactNative application designed to enhance safety measures within college and university campuses, particularly focusing on women's safety. The app incorporates features for incident reporting, predictive analytics, community involvement, and real-time intervention to prevent mishaps and ensure a secure campus environment.

## Problem Statement

College and university campuses should be vibrant and accommodating spaces that support idea exchange, personal growth, and soft skill development. However, safety, especially for women students, is crucial. Existing measures, such as CCTV cameras and increased security, are reactive and often insufficient. The objective is to develop predictive analytic models and community-based systems to prevent mishaps before they occur.

## Features

1. **Incident Reporting**:
   - Users can report incidents anonymously or non-anonymously, contributing to the collective safety of the campus.
   - Reported incidents are categorized and analyzed to identify patterns and potential risk areas.

2. **Predictive Analytics**:
   - The app utilizes predictive analytics to identify black spots and red time zones where incidents are more likely to occur.
   - It suggests the safest routes for women students to travel, considering real-time data and historical incident reports.

3. **Community Platform**:
   - A community-based system involves the entire student community in preventing mishaps.
   - Users can participate by reporting incidents, contributing data, and receiving real-time updates on campus safety.

4. **SOS Page**:
   - The app features an SOS page for immediate assistance in emergency situations.
   - Users can quickly alert campus authorities and designated contacts for help.

5. **Interactive Dashboard**:
   - Real-time monitoring is facilitated through an interactive dashboard and charts, providing insights into incident trends and campus safety status.

6. **Rapid Intervention**:
   - In addition to administrative and law enforcement intervention, the app enables rapid intervention by the student community in response to incidents or emergencies.

7. **Safe Travel Companion**:
   - A companion model assists students in navigating black spots and red time zones, ensuring safer travel experiences.
   - The model promotes community participation and a shared responsibility framework for campus safety.
